# ShoppingCart
This was to practice object-oriented programming in Java, I then ended up creating a program that stores items and gives output based on the user input. A user is able to select items, add to cart or search for specific item and the program will check if it is available in the list. This is done through the console, no GUI as of yet. Comments have been implemented to describe what the code is doing.

I also wanted to make this program as code efficient as possible using only the concepts that I know.
If I had to add more items to the list, the program will still function the same without having to change anything.

## I have gained a better understanding of
* Classes, objects
* Arraylist
* Control statements
* Enhanced loop
* Calling methods and passing in user input to check the condition
